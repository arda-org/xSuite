# Getting Started

xSuite makes the initialization, building, testing and deployment of contracts extremely easy.

## Your first contract deployed in seconds

Let's initialize, build, test and deploy your first MultiversX contract in seconds.

### 0. Install xSuite

The only requirement is to have Node.js 18+ already installed.

<details>
  <summary>Install Node.js 18+</summary>

Install the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/tree/v0.39.5#install--update-script) (NVM):

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
```

Then install Node.js 18:

```
nvm install 18
```

  You should then close and reopen your terminal.
</Callout>

</details>

Install xSuite:

```
npm install -g xsuite
```

### 1. Initialize the Contract

Create a new blank contract in the directory `first-contract` and open it:

```
xsuite new --dir first-contract
cd first-contract
```

### 2. Build the Contract

Install Rust that is necessary to build the contract:

```
xsuite install-rust
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  You should then close and reopen your terminal.
</Callout>

Build the contract:

```
npm run build
```

### 3. Test the Contract

Test the contract:

```
npm run test
```

### 4. Deploy the Contract

Create a new wallet, encrypted with the password of your choice:

```
xsuite new-wallet --wallet wallet.json
```

Fund this new wallet with 30 xEGLD, the fake EGLD of devnet:

```
xsuite request-xegld --wallet wallet.json
```

A page opens in your browser. Fill the captcha and request the tokens.

Deploy the contract to MultiversX devnet:

```
npm run interact:devnet deploy
```

Bravo! You have just deployed your first MultiversX smart contract! 🎉
