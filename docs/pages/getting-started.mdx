# Getting Started

xSuite makes the initialization, building, testing and deployment of contracts extremely easy.

## Your first contract deployed in seconds

Let's initialize, build, test and deploy your first MultiversX contract in seconds.

The only requirement is to have Node.js 18+ already installed.

<details>
  <summary>Install Node.js 18+</summary>

Install the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/tree/v0.39.5#install--update-script) (NVM):

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
```

Then install Node.js 18:

```
nvm install 18
```

  You should then close and reopen your terminal.

First, install `xsuite`:

```
npm install -g xsuite
```

Install Rust with the newly available `xsuite` command:

```
xsuite install-rust
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  You should then close and reopen your terminal.
</Callout>

Create a new blank contract in the directory `first-contract` and open it:

```
xsuite new --dir first-contract
cd first-contract
```

Create a new wallet, encrypted with the password of your choice:

```
xsuite new-wallet --wallet wallet.json
```

Fund this new wallet with 30 xEGLD, the fake EGLD of devnet:

```
xsuite request-xegld --wallet wallet.json
```

Build the contract:

```
npm run build
```

Test the contract:

```
npm run test
```

Deploy the contract to MultiversX devnet:

```
npm run interact:devnet deploy
```
