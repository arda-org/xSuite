# Getting Started

xSuite makes the initialization, building, testing and deployment of contracts extremely easy.

## Your first contract deployed in seconds

Let's initialize, build, test and deploy your first MultiversX contract in seconds.

The only requirement is to have Node.js 18+ already installed.

<details>
  <summary>Install Node.js 18+</summary>

Install the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/tree/v0.39.5#install--update-script) (NVM):

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
```

Then install Node.js 18:

```
nvm install 18
```

  You should then close and reopen your terminal.

</details>

1. Install `xsuite`:

   ```
   npm install -g xsuite
   ```

2. Install Rust with the newly available `xsuite` command:

   ```
   xsuite install-rust
   ```

   <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
     You should then close and reopen your terminal.
   </Callout>

3. Create a new blank contract in the directory `first-contract` and open it:

   ```
   xsuite new --dir first-contract
   cd first-contract
   ```

4. Create a new wallet, encrypted with the password of your choice:

   ```
   xsuite new-wallet --wallet wallet.json
   ```

5. Fund this new wallet with 30 xEGLD, the fake EGLD of devnet:

   ```
   xsuite request-xegld --wallet wallet.json
   ```

   A page opens in your browser. Fill the captcha and request the tokens.

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

7. Test the contract:

   ```
   npm run test
   ```

8. Deploy the contract to MultiversX devnet:

   ```
   npm run interact:devnet deploy
   ```
