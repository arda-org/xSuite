# Getting Started

xSuite makes the initialization, building, testing and deployment of contracts extremely easy.

## Your first contract deployed in seconds

Let's build, test and deploy your first MultiversX contract in seconds, with no requirement except Node.js 18+ being already installed.

First, install `xsuite`:

```
npm install -g xsuite
```

Install Rust with the newly available `xsuite` command:

```
xsuite install-rust
```

Create a new blank contract in the directory `first-contract` and open it:

```
xsuite new --dir first-contract
cd first-contract
```

Create a new wallet, encrypted with the password of your choice:

```
xsuite new-wallet --wallet wallet.json
```

Fund this new wallet with 30 xEGLD, the fake EGLD of devnet:

```
xsuite request-xegld --wallet wallet.json
```

Build the contract:

```
npm run build
```

Test the contract:

```
npm run test
```

Deploy the contract to MultiversX devnet:

```
npm run interact:devnet deploy
```
