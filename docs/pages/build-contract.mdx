# Build Contract

The 2nd step is to code and build your contract. xSuite CLI makes building super simple.

For this, Rust needs to be properly installed. To install it:

```
xsuite install-rust
```

You can then build your contract with:

```
xsuite build
```

If a `build` script is defined in the `package.json` of your contract, you can also run:

```
npm run build
```
