# Interact with Contract

The 4th and last step is to deploy your contract and interact with it on the real blockchain (devnet / testnet / mainnet). xSuite makes deploying and interacting super simple.

Instead of using a `SWorld` object like in tests, we will use a "real" `World` object, that interacts with the real blockchain.

The package `xsuite` also provides an `envChain` utility, to easily and quickly deploy contracts for the different networks.

## Your first interaction

Interactions are CLI commands written using the [commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) library. You should already have the `interact/data.json` and `interact/index.ts` files created after following the getting started guide. Below we will detail the contents of the files.

### interact/data.json

The `data.json` file contains information regarding your contracts and can be used with the `envChain` utility. Take the following `data.json` file:

```json
{
  "code": "file:output/contract.wasm",
  "address": {
    "devnet": "",
    "testnet": "",
    "mainnet": ""
  }
}
```

In Typescript code we can import the file and use the data under the fields directly. The `code` field contains the path to the contract wasm code, but the `address` is an object with fields for `devnet`, `testnet` and `mainnet`. These keys will be used by the `envChain` utility depending on the `CHAIN` env variable (which is set in the `package.json` file in the appropriate interact scripts for each environment) to select the address of the contract on that chain.

### interact/index.ts

The `interact/index.ts` file contains the commands of our CLI:


```ts
import { Command } from "commander";
import { envChain, World } from "xsuite";
import data from "./data.json";

const world = World.new({
  proxyUrl: envChain.publicProxyUrl(),
  chainId: envChain.id(),
  gasPrice: 1000000000,
});

const loadWallet = () => world.newWalletFromFile("wallet.json");

const program = new Command();

program.command("deploy").action(async () => {
  const wallet = await loadWallet();
  const result = await wallet.deployContract({
    code: data.code,
    codeMetadata: ["upgradeable"],
    gasLimit: 20_000_000,
  });
  console.log("Result:", result);
});

program.command("upgrade").action(async () => {
  const wallet = await loadWallet();
  const result = await wallet.upgradeContract({
    callee: envChain.select(data.address),
    code: data.code,
    codeMetadata: ["upgradeable"],
    gasLimit: 20_000_000,
  });
  console.log("Result:", result);
});

program.parse(process.argv);
```

The commands can then be run for devnet like follows:

```
npm run interact:devnet deploy
npm run interact:devnet upgrade
```

Let's break the file down and explain it.

### Imports

You should have the following imports at the top of the `interact/index.ts` file:

```ts
import { Command } from "commander";
import { envChain, World } from "xsuite";
import data from "./data.json";
```

We use the `Command` class from `commander` to allow us to write nice NodeJs CLI commands.

`envChain` is the utility we talked about previously. `World` is for interacting with the real blockchain (devnet / testnet / mainnet), similar to `SWorld` from tests for interacting with the simulnet.

We then import the `data.json` file and will use the `e` and `d` utilities from `xsuite` to encode/decode data respectively to a format that the MultiversX blockchain understands. More info on the [Data Encoding](/data-encoding) page

### World, wallet & program

Next, you should have the following variables:

```ts
const world = World.new({
  proxyUrl: envChain.publicProxyUrl(),
  chainId: envChain.id(),
  gasPrice: 1000000000,
});

const loadWallet = () => world.newWalletFromFile("wallet.json");

const program = new Command();
```

Here we define the `world` object using `World.new()` which takes the `proxyUrl`, `chainId` and `gasPrice` as arguments. Using the `envChain` utility we can easily get the appropriate `publicProxyUrl` (i.e. https://devnet-gateway.multiversx.com/ for Devnet) and chain `id` depending on the current `CHAIN` environment variable value that is set in the `scripts` section of our `package.json` file.

We then declare the function `loadWallet` to load a wallet from a `.json` file using the `world.newWalletFromFile()` function. The reason we don't call this directly is that we will get a password prompt after running this function, and we only want to trigger that after `commander` handles our custom command.

Finally, we initialize the `program` variable with an instance of the `Command` class.

### Basic commands

Finally, we can write our first basic commands:

```ts
program.command("deploy").action(async () => {
  const wallet = await loadWallet();
  const result = await wallet.deployContract({
    code: data.code,
    codeMetadata: ["upgradeable"],
    gasLimit: 20_000_000,
    codeArgs: [e.Str("ourString")],
  });
  console.log("Result:", result);
});

program.command("upgrade").action(async () => {
  const wallet = await loadWallet();
  const result = await wallet.upgradeContract({
    callee: envChain.select(data.address),
    code: data.code,
    codeMetadata: ["upgradeable"],
    gasLimit: 20_000_000,
    codeArgs: [e.Str("ourString")],
  });
  console.log("Result:", result);
});

program.parse(process.argv);
```

Here we declare two CLI commands, `deploy` and `upgrade` to easily manage our contract.

1. In the `deploy` command, we first call `loadWallet` to get a new instance of `Wallet`, which represents a wallet on the MultiversX blockchain. When calling this function, we will be prompted for the keystore file's password.

   Then we will deploy the contract code that comes from the `data.json` file's `code` key calling `wallet.deployContract()` function. Here we also pass the `codeMetadata` and make the contract `upgradable`, specify the `gasLimit` and any `codeArgs` which will be encoded using the `e` utility.

2. The `upgrade` is very similar to the `deploy` command. Here we use the `envChain.select()` function to get the correct address of our contract from the `data.json` file depending on the environment (devnet, testnet, mainnet) the command runs on (which comes from the `CHAIN` environmental variable).

## Advanced interactions

If you want to create more advanced commands, with advanced options or arguments, it is highly recommendeded to check out the [commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) documentation. However, below we will detail some examples on how to write more advanced interactions.

Suppose you want an interaction that takes some arguments, to easily create new resources. You could do something like this:

```ts
program
  .command("createOffer")
  .argument("token", "The id of the token")
  .argument("amount", "The amount to send")
  .action(async (token: string, amount: number) => {
    const wallet = await loadWallet();

    const result = await wallet.callContract({
      callee: envChain.select(data.address),
      gasLimit: 10_000_000,
      funcName: "createOffer",
      funcArgs: [
        e.Str(token),
        e.U64(BigInt(amount)),
      ],
    });
    console.log(result);
  });
```

You can call the above command like this for devnet:

```
npm run interact:devnet createOffer TOKEN-123456 1000
```

It will execute the transaction with `token` being `TOKEN-123456` and `amount` being `1000`. You can execute this command with different arguments to quickly create multiple resources.

Of course you are also not limited to calling only one `callContract` function or `query` function per command, or even deploying only one contract using `deployContract`. You can call the functions multiple times to setup more advanced contracts, like for example if you need to deploy 2 contract which depend on each other:

```ts
program
  .command("deploy")
  .argument("[decimals]", "The number of decimals with a default of 18", 18)
  .action(async (decimals: number) => {
    const wallet = await loadWallet();

    const result = await wallet.deployContract({
      code: data.code,
      codeMetadata: ["upgradeable"],
      gasLimit: 100_000_000,
      codeArgs: [
        e.U8(BigInt(decimals))
      ]
    });

    // Setup some data on the first contract
    const args: any[] = envChain.select(data.pairs);
    for (let [tokenIn, tokenOut] of args) {
      await wallet.callContract({
        callee: result.address,
        gasLimit: 20_000_000,
        funcName: "addPair",
        funcArgs: [
          e.Str(tokenIn),
          e.Str(tokenOut),
        ],
      });
    }

    // Deploy another contract that depends on the first one
    const resultOther = await wallet.deployContract({
      code: data.otherCode,
      codeMetadata: ["upgradeable"],
      gasLimit: 100_000_000,
      funcArgs: [
        e.Addr(result.address),
      ],
    });

    console.log("Contract Address:", result.address);
    console.log("Other Contract Address", resultOther.address);
  });
```

You can call the above command like this for devnet:

```
npm run interact:devnet deploy
```

The `decimals` argument is optional, and will have a default of `18` if it is not specified.

The `data.json` file for the above example could look something like this:

```json
{
  "code": "file:contract/output/contract.wasm",
  "otherCode": "file:otherContract/output/other-contract.wasm",
  "address": {
    "devnet": "",
    "testnet": "",
    "mainnet": ""
  },
  "otherAddress": {
    "devnet": "",
    "testnet": "",
    "mainnet": ""
  },
  "pairs": {
    "devnet": [
      ["WEGLD-d7c6bb", "USDC-8d4068"],
      ["WEGLD-d7c6bb", "ASH-4ce444"]
    ],
    "testnet": [],
    "mainnet": [
      ["WEGLD-bd4d79", "USDC-c76f1f"],
      ["WEGLD-bd4d79", "ASH-a642d1"]
    ]
  }
}
```

You can populate the `address` and `otherAddress` fields with the correct addresses of the contracts after the `deploy` command was run for an environment. Then you can use the `envChain.select()` utility in an `upgrade` command for example to upgrade both contracts.
