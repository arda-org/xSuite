xSuite is the full suite for efficiently developing high-quality MultiversX smart contracts. Init, build, test, deploy contracts in seconds.

xSuite is [made by Arda team](https://arda.run) and is the result of their deep expertise from building numerous dApps and auditing [35+ contracts](https://arda.run/audits). xSuite is extensively tested with 450+ tests and 100% test coverage of critical parts, to ensure it is always safe and reliable.

## Your first contract deployed in seconds

Let's build, test and deploy your first MultiversX contract in seconds, with no requirement except Node.js 18+ being already installed on your machine.

First, install `xsuite-cli`:

```
npm install -g xsuite-cli
```

A new command `xsuite` is now available in your terminal. With this command, install Rust on your machine:

```
xsuite install-rust
```

Create a new blank contract in the directory `my-contract` and open it:

```
xsuite new --dir my-contract
cd my-contract
```

Create a new wallet, encrypted with the password of your choice:

```
xsuite new-wallet --wallet wallet.json
```

Fund this new wallet with 30 xEGLD, the fake EGLD of devnet:

```
xsuite request-xegld --wallet wallet.json
```

Build the contract:

```
npm run build
```

Test the contract:

```
npm run test
```

Deploy the contract to MultiversX devnet:

```
npm run interact:devnet deploy
```

## Onboarding and Training

If you want you or your team to receive a personal onboarding and training to xSuite, please contact [Lucas Willems](https://t.me/LucasWillems).

## Starter Contracts (audited)

Arda team has created starter contracts to be used as a great starting point for the development of your new smart contract and to save a significant amount of time into setting up the codebase and writing the initial logic. Starter contracts are **audited by Arda**.

The starter contracts available:

- [blank](https://github.com/arda-org/xSuite/tree/main/contracts/blank): An empty contract that comes fully set up with tests and blockchain interactions.
- [vested-transfers](https://github.com/arda-org/xSuite/tree/main/contracts/vested-transfers): A contract for vested transfers, with tests and blockchain interactions.

## Who is using xSuite?

xSuite has been used internally by Arda since more than a year, and has been released publicly recently. Many ecosystem teams have started to be onboarded and trained to use xSuite. To get your team onboarded and trained too, please contact [Lucas Willems](https://t.me/LucasWillems).
