# Getting Started

xSuite is the full suite for efficiently developing high-quality MultiversX smart contracts. Init, build, test, deploy contracts in seconds.

xSuite is [made by Arda team](https://arda.run) and is the result of their deep expertise from building numerous dApps and auditing [35+ contracts](https://arda.run/audits). xSuite is extensively tested with 450+ tests and 100% test coverage of critical parts, to ensure it is always safe and reliable.

## Your first contract deployed in seconds

Let's build, test and deploy your first MultiversX contract in seconds, with no requirement except Node.js 18+ being already installed on your machine.

First, install `xsuite-cli`:

```
npm install -g xsuite-cli
```

A new command `xsuite` is now available in your terminal. With this command, install Rust on your machine:

```
xsuite install-rust
```

*Note: If you already have Rust installed and the `cargo` command available you can skip this step (eg: if you use `mxpy` or have manually installed Rust before)*

Create a new blank contract in the directory `my-contract` and open it:

```
xsuite new --dir my-contract
cd my-contract
```

Create a new wallet, encrypted with the password of your choice:

```
xsuite new-wallet --wallet wallet.json
```

Fund this new wallet with 30 xEGLD, the fake EGLD of devnet:

```
xsuite request-xegld --wallet wallet.json
```

Build the contract:

```
npm run build
```

Test the contract:

```
npm run test
```

Deploy the contract to MultiversX devnet:

```
npm run interact:devnet deploy
```

## Adding xSuite to existing contracts

xSuite can easily be added to existing contracts as well.

Init a new `npm` package in the root of your contract(s) and add the required dependencies:

```
npm init
npm i --save-dev xsuite vitest typescript tsx commander
```

Add the following `scripts` in the `package.json` file:

```
  "scripts": {
    "build": "xsuite build",
    "test": "vitest run",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "interact:devnet": "CHAIN=devnet tsx interact/index.ts",
    "interact:testnet": "CHAIN=testnet tsx interact/index.ts",
    "interact:mainnet": "CHAIN=mainnet tsx interact/index.ts"
  },
```

Create the `tests` and `interact` directory

```
mkdir tests interact
```

Create the first test file under `tests/contract.test.ts`, with the following content:

```ts
import { test, beforeEach, afterEach } from "vitest";
import { assertAccount } from "xsuite/assert";
import { FWorld, FWorldWallet, FWorldContract } from "xsuite/world";

let world: FWorld;
let deployer: FWorldWallet;
let contract: FWorldContract;

beforeEach(async () => {
  world = await FWorld.start();
  deployer = await world.createWallet();
  ({ contract } = await deployer.deployContract({
    code: "file:output/contract.wasm",
    codeMetadata: [],
    gasLimit: 10_000_000,
  }));
});

afterEach(async () => {
  await world.terminate();
});

test("Test", async () => {
  assertAccount(await contract.getAccountWithPairs(), {
    balance: 0n,
    hasPairs: [],
  });
});

```

Create the `interact/data.json` file with the following content:
```json
{
  "code": "file:output/contract.wasm",
  "address": {
    "devnet": "",
    "testnet": "",
    "mainnet": ""
  }
}

```

Create the `interact/index.ts` file with the following content:
```ts
import { Command } from "commander";
import { envChain } from "xsuite/interact";
import { World } from "xsuite/world";
import data from "./data.json";

const world = World.new({
  proxyUrl: envChain.publicProxyUrl(),
  chainId: envChain.id(),
  gasPrice: 1000000000,
});

const loadWallet = () => world.newWalletFromFile("wallet.json");

const program = new Command();

program.command("deploy").action(async () => {
  const wallet = await loadWallet();
  const result = await wallet.deployContract({
    code: data.code,
    codeMetadata: ["upgradeable"],
    gasLimit: 20_000_000,
  });
  console.log("Result:", result);
});

program.command("upgrade").action(async () => {
  const wallet = await loadWallet();
  const result = await wallet.upgradeContract({
    callee: envChain.select(data.address),
    code: data.code,
    codeMetadata: ["upgradeable"],
    gasLimit: 20_000_000,
  });
  console.log("Result:", result);
});

program.command("ClaimDeveloperRewards").action(async () => {
  const wallet = await loadWallet();
  const result = await wallet.callContract({
    callee: envChain.select(data.address),
    funcName: "ClaimDeveloperRewards",
    gasLimit: 10_000_000,
  });
  console.log("Result:", result);
});

program.parse(process.argv);

```

Edit the above files to suit your contract needs. At this point, you should be able to run tests with `npm run test` and the interactions with `npm run interact:devnet deploy`.

*Note: The interactions use a `wallet.json` file which can be generated using `npm run interact:devnet deploy`*

## Starter Contracts (audited)

Arda team has created starter contracts to be used as a great starting point for the development of your new smart contract and to save a significant amount of time into setting up the codebase and writing the initial logic. Starter contracts are **audited by Arda**.

The starter contracts available:

- [blank](https://github.com/arda-org/xSuite/tree/main/contracts/blank): An empty contract that comes fully set up with tests and blockchain interactions.
- [vested-transfers](https://github.com/arda-org/xSuite/tree/main/contracts/vested-transfers): A contract for vested transfers, with tests and blockchain interactions.

## Onboarding and Training

If you want you or your team to receive a personal onboarding and training to xSuite, please contact [Lucas Willems](https://t.me/LucasWillems).

## Who is using xSuite?

xSuite has been used internally by Arda since more than a year, and has been released publicly recently. Many ecosystem teams have started to be onboarded and trained to use xSuite. To get your team onboarded and trained too, please contact [Lucas Willems](https://t.me/LucasWillems).

## Community

The xSuite community can be found on [xSuite Telegram group](https://t.me/xSuite_js), where you can ask questions, share ideas and meet other community members.
