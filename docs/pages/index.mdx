# Getting Started

xSuite is the full suite for efficiently developing high-quality MultiversX smart contracts. Init, build, test, deploy contracts in seconds.

xSuite is made by [the Arda team](https://arda.run) and is the result of their deep expertise from building numerous dApps and auditing [35+ contracts](https://arda.run/audits). xSuite is extensively tested with 450+ tests and 100% test coverage of critical parts, to ensure it is always safe and reliable.

A big thank you to [the Buidly team](https://twitter.com/buidly_) who intensively used xSuite in their projects, provided valuable feedback and drafted the first version of the documentation.

## Your first contract deployed in seconds

Let's build, test and deploy your first MultiversX contract in seconds, with no requirement except Node.js 18+ being already installed on your machine.

First, install `xsuite`:

```
npm install -g xsuite
```

Install Rust with the newly available `xsuite` command:

```
xsuite install-rust
```

Create a new blank contract in the directory `first-contract` and open it:

```
xsuite new --dir first-contract
cd first-contract
```

Create a new wallet, encrypted with the password of your choice:

```
xsuite new-wallet --wallet wallet.json
```

Fund this new wallet with 30 xEGLD, the fake EGLD of devnet:

```
xsuite request-xegld --wallet wallet.json
```

Build the contract:

```
npm run build
```

Test the contract:

```
npm run test
```

Deploy the contract to MultiversX devnet:

```
npm run interact:devnet deploy
```

## Starter Contracts (audited)

Starter contracts are a great starting point for your new smart contract. They will save you significant time setting up the codebase and writing the initial logic. They are **audited by Arda**. [View starter contracts](/new-contract#setup-contract-using-cli).

## Onboarding and Training

If you want you or your team to receive a personal onboarding and training to xSuite, please contact [Lucas Willems](https://t.me/LucasWillems).

## Who is using xSuite?

xSuite has been used internally by Arda since more than a year, and has been released publicly recently. Many ecosystem teams have started to be onboarded and trained to use xSuite. To get your team onboarded and trained too, please contact [Lucas Willems](https://t.me/LucasWillems).
