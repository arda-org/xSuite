# Data Decoding

The `d` utility provides almost the same data types as the `e` utility, but instead of encoding the data it allows decoding of the data. It is useful when wanting to decode data returned by a query.

For example, if the contract has the `positions` storage mapper:

```
#[view]
#[storage_mapper("positions")]
fn positions(&self, address: &ManagedAddress, token: &TokenIdentifier) -> VecMapper<Position<Self::Api>>;
```

and we would want to decode the data returned by the mapper, we could use:

```ts
import { e, d } from "xsuite";

const { returnData } = await world.query({
  callee: contract,
  funcName: "positions",
  funcArgs: [
    e.Addr(address),
    e.Str("TOKEN-123456")
  ],
});

const positions = d.List(
  d.Tuple({
    name: d.Str(),
    timestamp: d.U32(),
    price: d.U(),
  })
).topDecode(returnData[0]);
```

The supported types are identical to the ones from the [Data Encoding](/data-encoding) page.
