## Starter Contracts (audited)

Arda team has created starter contracts to be used as a great starting point for the development of your new smart contract and to save a significant amount of time into setting up the codebase and writing the initial logic. Starter contracts are **audited by Arda**.

The starter contracts available:

- [blank](https://github.com/arda-org/xSuite/tree/main/contracts/blank): An empty contract that comes fully set up with tests and blockchain interactions.
- [vested-transfers](https://github.com/arda-org/xSuite/tree/main/contracts/vested-transfers): A contract for vested transfers, with tests and blockchain interactions.
