xSuite is the complete suite for efficiently developing high-quality MultiversX smart contracts. Init, build, test, deploy contracts in seconds.

xSuite is made by [the Arda team](https://arda.run) and is the result of their deep expertise from building numerous dApps and auditing [35+ contracts](https://arda.run/audits). xSuite is extensively tested with 450+ tests and 100% test coverage of critical parts, to ensure it is always safe and reliable.

A big thank you to [the Buidly team](https://twitter.com/buidly_) who intensively used xSuite in their projects, provided valuable feedback and drafted the first version of the documentation.
