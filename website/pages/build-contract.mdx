# Build Contract

The 2nd step is to code and build your contract. xSuite makes building super simple.

For this, Rust needs to be properly installed. To install it:

```
xsuite install-rust
```

You can now build your contract with:

```
xsuite build
```

You can also add the script `"build": "xsuite build"` to the `package.json` of your contract and then build using:

```
npm run build
```
